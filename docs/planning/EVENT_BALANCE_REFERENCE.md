## Balance Guidelines

### Resource Values
- **Small**: 1 or 1d2
- **Medium**: 1d3 or 2
- **Large**: 1d4, 2d3, or 3

### Typical Outcome Patterns

**Virtuous approaches:**
- Best fame gains
- Moderate resource gains
- Safest failure outcomes

**Practical approaches:**
- Best gold gains
- Moderate unrest reduction
- Balanced risk/reward

**Ruthless approaches:**
- Best unrest reduction (via conversion)
- Creates prison management burden
- Harshest failure penalties (innocent imprisonment, fame loss)

### Prison Mechanics
- **Convert X**: Reduces unrest by X, adds X to imprisoned
- **Pardon X**: Reduces imprisoned by X (no unrest change)
- **+X innocents**: Adds X to imprisoned without reducing unrest
