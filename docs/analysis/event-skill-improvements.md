## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with High Priority** - These events have clear thematic fits for underrepresented skills
2. **Update 5-10 events per batch** - Test balance after each batch
3. **Re-run analysis** - Check improved distribution
4. **Iterate** - Adjust as needed based on results

## Skill Addition Guidelines

When adding skills to existing approaches:

1. **Check thematic fit** - Does it make narrative sense?
2. **Don't overcrowd** - Keep 3-4 skills per approach maximum
3. **Diversify archetypes** - Each approach should appeal to different character types
4. **Update descriptions if needed** - Ensure skill fits the approach description
