## Design Guidelines for Future Events

### ✅ DO:
1. **Start with underrepresented skills** - Check Arcana, Acrobatics, Athletics, Medicine, Crafting first
2. **Mix archetypes** - Ensure wizards, warriors, and healers have options alongside social characters
3. **Create 4+ skill options** - More variety means more characters can contribute
4. **Consider non-social approaches** - Not every problem needs Diplomacy or Intimidation

### ❌ DON'T:
1. **Default to Society/Diplomacy/Intimidation** - Already 58% of checks
2. **Forget combat characters** - Warriors need more than just Intimidation
3. **Ignore magical solutions** - Wizards should be useful beyond rare arcane investigations
4. **Overlook practical skills** - Medicine, Crafting, and Athletics are underused

### python3 buildscripts/analyze-event-skills.py New Event Template

When designing new events, use this checklist:

```
[ ] Does this event use an underrepresented skill? (Arcana, Acrobatics, Athletics, Medicine, Crafting, Lore)
[ ] Can a wizard/arcanist meaningfully contribute?
[ ] Can a warrior/fighter meaningfully contribute (beyond Intimidation)?
[ ] Are there 4+ different skill options?
[ ] Does at least one option NOT use Society/Diplomacy/Intimidation?
```

## Conclusion

The event system provides **universal coverage** across all character archetypes, which is excellent. However, there's significant **opportunity imbalance**:

- **Social characters** (diplomats, scholars, leaders) have 3-5x more opportunities than others
- **Magical characters** (wizards, arcanists) are notably underserved
- **Martial characters** (warriors, monks) rely heavily on Intimidation with few athletic options
- **Support characters** (healers, crafters) have limited spotlight moments

**Target Balance:** Ideally, each major archetype should have 8-12% representation, creating more equitable opportunities for diverse party compositions.

**Next Steps:** When implementing new events or incidents, prioritize the underrepresented skills to create better balance over time.
