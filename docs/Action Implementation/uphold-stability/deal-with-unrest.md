## Notes

This is one of the simplest actions in the system. It's a good reference example for:
- Multiple skill options (8 different approaches)
- Clean modifier application
- End-of-turn timing (noted in Actions.md but doesn't affect implementation)
- Even failure provides benefit (reduces unrest by 1)
