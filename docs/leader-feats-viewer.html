When you select this feat, you should detail the fundamental tenets of your splinter faith, though it shouldn't affect the deity's edicts or anathema. Choose four domains. These domains must be chosen from among your deity's domains, your deity's alternate domains, and up to one domain that isn't on either list and isn't anathematic to your deity. Any domain spell you cast from a domain that isn't on either of your deity's lists is always heightened to 1 rank lower than usual for a focus spell. For the purpose of abilities that depend on your deity's domains, the four domains you chose are your deity's domains, and any of your deity's domains you didn't choose are now among your deity's alternate domains. Special Unless you take this feat at 1st level, changing the way you relate to your deity requires retraining, as described in the Changing Faith section below. If you take this feat and previously benefited from any effect that requires a domain your splinter faith doesn't include, such as a domain spell from Domain Initiate, you lose that effect.

Droskar intercepts your prayers and answers them without the named god knowing.

The GM might determine an attunement applies as long as it's prevalent enough around you. For instance, you might be in aquatic terrain on a riverbank or on a boat. Similarly, one place might count as multiple types of terrain, such as a mountain in the far north being both arctic and mountain. In this case, you choose only one terrain attunement effect, even if the spell has traits that would apply to each terrain type. Certain terrain attunements affect your enemies instead of you. If they do, when you cast the spell you apply the listed effect to all enemies who are either adjacent to you, in the area of the spell, or targeted by the spell. These enemies receive the listed saving throw against your spell DC to attempt to avoid the effect. Aquatic (water) You ride the currents of water. If you're in the water, you gain a swim Speed equal to your land Speed. If you're on a surface, temporary waves of water follow your movements, allowing you to use your swim Speed-if you have one-as your land Speed. This effect lasts one round. Arctic (cold) Arctic rime covers your foes' bodies. Enemies must attempt a Fortitude save. They take a –5-foot status penalty to their Speeds for 2 rounds (-10-foot on a critical failure). Desert (fire) The scorching heat of the desert dehydrates your foes. Enemies must attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, they're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fatigued] until they drink water or another potable liquid. Forest (plant) Branches and vines reach out to get in your foes' way. Enemies must attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, they become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy]{Clumsy 1} for 1 round (@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy]{Clumsy 2} on a critical failure). Mountain (earth) The rugged endurance of the mountain protects you from harm. You gain resistance to physical damage (except adamantine) equal to the spell rank for 1 round. Plains (plant) The growing fields and pulsing vitality of the plains provide you vigor. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to the spell rank for 1 round. Sky (air) A gust of wind carries you aloft. You can Fly up to 10 feet. If you're in the air at the end of the turn and don't have a fly Speed, you fall. Swamp (plant) Your magic draws in noxious swamp gas to fumigate your foes. Affected foes take @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Persistent Damage]{Persistent Poison Damage} equal to half the spell's rank (minimum 1 damage) with a basic Fortitude save. Underground (earth) The endless darkness of the cavern depths opens up its secrets to your senses. For 1 round, you gain darkvision as well as imprecise tremorsense out to 15 feet. @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.I6FbkKYncDuu7eWq]{Geomancer}"},{"_id":"H6SL2F11nlMfqCQC","name":"Improvise Admixture","level":2,"category":"class","traits":["alchemist","concentrate","manipulate"],"source":"class/alchemist/improvise-admixture","scores":{"idealist":0,"practical":11,"ruthless":0},"bestMatch":"practical","description":"Frequency once per day Requirements You have fewer than y...","summary":"Attempt a check check.","fullDescription":"Frequency once per day Requirements You have fewer than your maximum number of versatile vials, and you're either holding or wearing an alchemist's toolkit.

Choose Nature, Occultism, or Religion when you select this feat. Nature allows you to contact the spirits of nature that form leshies, who are born of pure life essence rather than spiritual energy and can answer questions about natural features like the location of nearby water or plant life. Religion reveals the presence of angelic, demonic, or other spirits in service to divine beings, who provide information about sources of powerful life energy or energy from the Void; sacred or profane influences; or the presence of undead. Occultism allows you to contact lingering spirits, psychic echoes of the departed dead, and spirits from beyond reality, who tell you about things like strange auras, effects, or the presence of unnatural occult beings. Spend 10 minutes and attempt a check to Recall Knowledge with the chosen skill; the DC is determined by the GM (usually a very high DC for the level of the highest-level creature you might encounter in the area).

Critical Success The spirits reveal themselves to you and have a helpful attitude toward you. Only you can perceive these spirits. They answer three simple questions about the environment within 100 feet of you, depending on the skill you chose and thus the type of spirits you contact. Their answers are almost always a single word, and their knowledge is limited to within their area of interest. Success As with a critical success, but the spirits are indifferent to you and answer only one question. Failure You are unable to contact the spirits of this place.

Either an old enemy resumes their efforts to affect chaos and violence, or a new threat arises and you feel compelled to stand against it. You've stood against evil before, and the time is nigh for you to do so once again. When you select this mythic destiny, work with your GM to determine the best choice for which previous PC or NPC serves as the source of your reincarnation. For the Revenge of the Runelords Adventure Path in particular, any PC who played a role in the Rise of the Runelords, Shattered Star, or Return of the Runelords Adventure Paths makes for a perfect fit—as would any allied NPC who, in your previous campaign, perished before the end. A heroic scion comes into the world when a nemesis from their old adventures returns. In the case of this campaign, the heroic scion's nemesis are the ancient runelords of Thassilon. In other campaigns, this nemesis can be a specific individual, a coterie of rivals, or an organization you're destined to oppose. You instinctively know when your nemesis is active in the world. This knowledge may begin as nightmares or a feeling of inevitable conflict but grows stronger and more specific as you contemplate further. You also know when this entity or group has been fully defeated and ceases to operate at all. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Seek] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sense Motive] whenever an ally or servant of your nemesis attempts to Lie to you, escape your notice, or Impersonate someone else. Fate has deemed you incredibly hard to kill. You reduce the DC of recovery checks by 1. Choose one skill that's not a Lore skill, based on the themes of your reincarnated heroic source. Your GM can help you determine a list of appropriate skills to choose from. When you employ an action using that skill, you may spend a Mythic Point to attempt the associated check at mythic proficiency. Finally, you gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Additional Lore] feat for a special Lore skill subcategory—Incarnation Lore. This Lore skill allows you to become aware of or recall your past exploits. When you increase your proficiency in Incarnation Lore, you remember more about your previous adventures.

Pull of Stasis (transmutation) Weapon only. Any time you hit with the soulforged weapon, the target takes a –10-foot penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. On a critical hit, the creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Immobilized] for 1 round instead. Corruption Flaw You take a –10-foot penalty to all your Speeds.

The oath's power is overwhelming—too much for a mortal frame—but victory is worth any price. When you use this feat, you cry out the final line of the Crimson Oath, unleashing unbridled power for 1 minute. You can Dismiss this effect. While this effect is active, you gain the following effects: At the beginning of each of your turns, you become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Drained]{Drained 1} or increase the value of your drained condition by 1 if you are already drained. You can't reduce the value of your drained condition or remove it while The Tyrant Falls! is active. While The Tyrant Falls! is active, your drained condition does not penalize your Fortitude save. You can cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Invoke the Crimson Oath] at will without expending Focus Points. When you do, increase the area to a @Template[cone|distance:40]. You gain resistance to all damage equal to half your character level. Any melee weapon you wield gains the reach trait if it didn't already possess it, or increases its reach by 5 feet if it already has the reach trait.
