## Description

Allows players to found new village-tier settlements with custom naming and optional bonus structure on critical success.

## Custom Resolution

Shows naming dialog on **success** and **critical success**:

## Workflow

1. Player selects "Establish Settlement" action
2. Makes skill check
3. On success: Dialog appears for naming
4. Settlement created at location `{x: 0, y: 0}` (unmapped - must be placed on Kingmaker hex map)
5. On critical success: Bonus structure added automatically
