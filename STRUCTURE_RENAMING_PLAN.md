## 🎯 Design Philosophy

**Tier 1 (Frontier):** Rough, makeshift, survival-focused. Think struggling outpost.
**Tier 2 (Village):** Basic functionality, still humble but organized.
**Tier 3 (Town):** Respectable, professional, established quality.
**Tier 4 (Metropolis):** Opulent, prestigious, grand and magnificent.
