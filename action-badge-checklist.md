**Total: 26 actions**

**Note:** "Missing badges" means you don't see ANY badges at all in the "Possible Outcomes" section for success/critical success. Some actions may show badges for failure outcomes (like "-1 Unrest") - that's okay, we're only checking if success outcomes have badges.

**Examples of what badges SHOULD look like:**
- "Claim 1 hex" (Claim Hexes)
- "Build road in 1 hex" (Build Roads)
- "-2 Unrest" (Deal with Unrest)
- "Explore 1 hex" (Send Scouts)
